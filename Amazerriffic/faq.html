            <h3>Dummy text: Its function as a filler or as a tool for
            comparing the visual impression of different typefaces?</h3>
            <div class="answer">
                <p>Dummy text is text that is used in the publishing industry
                or by web designers to occupy the space which will later be
                filled with 'real' content. This is required when, for example,
                the final text is not yet available. Dummy text is also known
                as 'fill text'. It is said that song composers of the past
                used dummy texts as lyrics when writing melodies in order
                to have a 'ready-made' text to sing with the melody.
                Dummy texts have been in use by typesetters since the 16th century.</p>

            <h3>The usefulness of nonsensical content?</h3>
            <div class="answer">
                <p>Dummy text is also used to demonstrate the
                appearance of different typefaces and layouts,
                and in general the content of dummy text is nonsensical.
                Due to its widespread use as filler text for layouts,
                non-readability is of great importance: human perception
                is tuned to recognize certain patterns and repetitions in texts.
                If the distribution of letters and 'words' is random, the reader
                will not be distracted from making a neutral judgement on the visual
                impact and readability of the typefaces (typography),
                or the distribution of text on the page (layout or type area).
                For this reason, dummy text usually consists of a more or
            </div>
    
            <h3/>Incomprehensibility or readability? That is the question.</h3>
            <div class="answer">
                <p>The most well-known dummy text is the 'Lorem Ipsum', which is said to
                have originated in the 16th century. Lorem Ipsum is composed in a pseudo-Latin
                language which more or less corresponds to 'proper' Latin. It contains a series of
                real Latin words.
